#### Command Format:

To understand how a full command is interpreted, we will utilise the following example.

**Example:** `add n/NAME id/STUDENT_ID p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS in/INTAKE m/MAJOR [t/TAG]â€¦â€‹`

|             | Component Name    | Meaning                                                        |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`add`**   | Command           | Will result in the execution of the Add Command by EduLink-NUS |
| **`n/`**    | Parameter Prefix  | Distinguishes `NAME` from other input fields.                  |
| **`NAME`**  | Parameter         | Represents placeholder for name of the student.                |

Certainly, here's a revised version:

You'll notice that `[TAG]` is wrapped in square brackets, indicating that it's an optional component.

- For example, in `n/STUDENT_NAME [TAG]`, you can include a tag like `n/John t/TA` or simply input the student's name as `n/John`.

Moreover, notice that `[TAG]` is followed by an ellipsis (`â€¦`). This signifies that items followed by an ellipsis can be entered multiple times, including zero times.

- As an illustration, `n/STUDENT_NAME [TAG]â€¦` can be used with no tags at all, like `n/John`, or with multiple tags, such as `n/John t/Math t/TA`.

**General Notes about EduLink-NUS:**<br>

* Duplicate student entires is defined as 2 person who have identical `STUDENT_ID`.

* Unless explicitly stated otherwise, when indicating character limitations, spaces between words are counted within the total character count, while any leading or trailing spaces are not included in the calculation.

</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Commands are case-insensitive. e.g `filter` and `Filter` are the same command.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/TA` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `â€¦`â€‹ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `Â ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/TA`, `t/TA t/Helpful` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* The `INDEX` value must fall within the range of 1 to 2,147,483,647. Any value outside of this range will be deemed incorrect. Moreover, if the value falls within the specified range but is not found in the student list panel, it will be considered out of bounds.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**VERY IMPORTANT !!!**<br>

* **TAB** key serve a distinct purpose and should now be utilised for creating four whitespaces.

* Any parameter supplied by the user must not contain the **/** character as it serves a distinct purpose in the application.

### Search Students by Name or ID: `find`

This command facilitates the search for students in the EduLink NUS application based on their **Names**, **Student IDs**, or **Both**. Matching students will be displayed on the Student List Panel.

Formats: `find n/NAME`, `find id/STUDENT_ID`, **OR** `find n/NAME id/STUDENT_ID`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `john` will match `John`, `a1234567x` will match `A1234567X`
* The search by name supports partial word matching, but must be in chronological order e.g. `John` will match `Jonathan`. And `nathan` will not match with `Jonathan`.
* When searching by name with multiple words, only entries with the same chronological combination of the search words will match. It disregards the specific location of the match. e.g. `Li A` will successfully match `John Li An`.
  Additionally, `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Bober`, `Hans Bober` and not `Hans Mayer`
* The search by ID supports partial word matching and does not need to be in chronological order e.g. `A123` will match `A1234567X`. And `2345` will match with `A1234567X`.
* When searching by both ID and name, only entries with IDs and names that match both criteria will be returned.
 e.g. `Hans Bo` and `A1234` will return entries that has names that includes `Hans Bo` and IDs with `A1234`.

Examples:
* `find n/John` returns `john`, `John Doe`, `Johnathan`
* `find n/alex david` returns `Alex David`, `Alex Davidson`
* `find id/A1234567X` returns a person with ID `A12345678X`
* `find id/A123` returns entries with IDs with `A123`
* `find id/A1234567X n/John Doe` returns a person `John Doe` with ID `A12345678X`
* `find id/234 n/John D` returns a person `Jeff John Doe Leong` with ID `A12345678X`


### Filtering List of Students: `filter`

Filter displayed list of students on the Student List Panel based on a tag or tags.

Format: `filter t/TAG [t/TAG] â€¦â€‹`

* Tag names are case-insensitive. e.g `TA` will match `Ta`
* The order of the tags does not matter. e.g. result for `TA` and `Knowledgeable` will match `Knowledgeable` and `TA`.
* Only full words will be matched, no support for partial word matches. e.g. `TA` will not match `TAPotential`.
* Persons matching all tags listed will be returned. E.g. Person with `TA` tag only will not be returned, if tags
  specified includes `TA` and `Year 2`.

Examples:
* `filter t/CS2103T` will display only people that have been tagged with `CS2103T`.

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
